# SHam InVadorz (shiv)

A small fun game designed to congratulate one of my coworkers. As the previous winner of the "Innovation Award"
it was my duty to come up with a creative way to pass the award onto someone new. Chris Sham is the recipient
of the award this time around, and this game is dedicated to him.

## Run the game

For a quick setup you can use the built in webserver:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/englercj/shiv.git
cd shiv &&
npm install &&
./bin/shiv
```

Then visit `yoursite.com:8001` to play.
